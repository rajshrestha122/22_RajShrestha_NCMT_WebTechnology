1) Define the  term "Protocol" in the context of the internet.
ans= Protocol is a standard set of rules mantaining how data is formatted, transmitted, received and
interpreted between devices and systems. for examples http,ftp,tcp/ip ect.

2) what is the primary difference between a web browser and a search engine?
ans= A web browser is the software you use to access and view websites,while a search engine is a 
website or service within the browser that finds other website and information for you by indexing 
the web.

3) Define the World Wide Web(WWW).
ans=  WWW stands for the vast system of interconnected documents accessed through internet using 
hyperlinks to share scientific info , and now a core part of the internet for general information 
access.

4) Distinguish between a static web page and a dynamic web page.
ans= Static pages serve fixed,  pre-built content that appears the same for every visitor, while 
dynamic web pages  generate content content in realtime often tailored to user interaction or
information from a database.

5) Explain the Client-Server architecture of the web with a neat daigram.
ans=  Client-Server architecture is a model where tasks are split between client and server  over a
network using a request-response pattern.
IT is centralize which makes us to manage easily,securely and create backups of data on the
server .It  can handel many users by adding more server power which dristributess
workload,allowing many clients to use shared resources for efficiency.

6) Describe the functions of the following internet services:Email,FTP and VoIP.
and= Mentioned internet services are foundational internert services with distinct primary functions

Email(Electronic Mail): The primary function of email is to allow users to send,receive and manage 
digital messages and attachments over the internet.It serves as a near instaneous, global communication
method enabling both  personal and professional correspondences.

FTP(File Tranfer Protocol): FTPs core function  is to facilitate the transfer of file between a client and 
a server on a computer network. It is primamrilyy used for uploading webpages,images and other document 
to a websites server or for downloading large software files or data backups.

VoIP(Voice over IP): the function  of VoIP is to provide voice communication and multimedia sessions over
internt protocol networks. It translate voice signals into digital data packets and sends them across the
network, enabling phone calls,video conferencing and other collaborative services to be made using an 
internet conncetion instead of traditional phone lines.


7) "The Internet is a network of networks". Elaborate on this statement explaining how packet switching 
works.
Ans= The internet isn't a single,monolithic entity. Instead it is a vast decentralied collection of 
LANs,MANs and WANs belonging to homes,business,government,universities and internet service Provider.
These diverse network are linked together through devices like routers and switches, which  communicate
using the copmmon Internet Protocol Suite(TCP/IP). This creates a structure where structure where data 
can seamlessly flow from a device on one local network to a device on another regardless of the underlying 
physical technologies. so internet is called as the network of networks.

Packet switching works by breacking data into small packets,adding header into (Sourc,destination.sequence)
sending them independently across shared network paths via routers(swhich find the best route), then 
reassembling them at the destination,allowing for efficient resources sharing and fault tolerance as packet 
can take different routes to avoid congestion.

8) A startup company wants to host a website that displays the same information to all visitors and requires
very low maintainance costs. However,they are being advised to use a dynamic website.As a consultant,would you
agree? Justify your answer
Ans= As an consultant I would never agree with that advice of using dynamic website in this case because a startup
company need a website that displays the same information to all visitors and require very ow maintainance cost 
points directly to a static website solution.
static websites are pre built files served directly to users.They donot involve server side processing for 
each reqquest.whereas dynamic websites generate content on the fly based on user requests,server side scripts and
databasees.and  it is more complex to operate and maintainance is higher than static websitesand somehow
it has also more potential vulnerablities that need constant monitoiring and patching.and accordingly 
static website is low maintainance withn high performance and more enhanced  security with cost effective 
hostingand they handle traffick spikes easily because serving static files is less resources intensive
thus static website will be more suitable for this case.

9) A user types www.google.com into their browser, but the browser displays a ”Server Not
Found” error, even though the internet connection is active. However, accessing the site
via 142.250.190.46 works. Diagnose the problem and explain the underlying technology
that failed.
Ans= the problem is on Domain NAme System. the user can access google's website using its ip address but not its domain name 
it indicate that the internet connection is working and googles server is operational and reachable. the issue is 
in the translatiion process from the human readable domain name  to the machine readable ip address
 in this case Server not found error means that the DNS  resolution process failed. COmputers DNS resolver could not 
successfully transate www.google.com into ip address
acc. to google possible reason for DNS failure includes 
incorect DNS server configuration , corrupted DNS cache , ISP DNS Issue, blockage of DNS  by Firewall and due to malware

since accessing the site via the ip address woorks, we knmow the probles is not with googles server or users general 
internet conncetion. The failure is specifically is in the DNS lookup process  that translate the domain name to its 
corresponding ip adress.


10) A multinational corporation wants to share sensitive inventory data with specific suppliers
but does not want this information available to the general public. Explain which network
type (Intranet, Extranet, or Internet) they should implement and why.
Anss= If corporation wnats to share data withoout leaking information to general public, then they should use or implem,ent
Extranet.Because Extranet offers the prefect balance between accesibilityy and securuty for this scenario
on this the corporation can grant specific login credentials and permissiona ensuring only authorix eperson can access those data.
Extra net are protected byy firewalls,encryptions abd other security protocols safeguarding the sensitive data/information  from unauthorize 
access by general public.
extranet facilitate secure colaboration and data exhange data without exposing internal system or data to the wiber network 
and extra net is more  cost effective network  for this case  so in my POV they should implement Extranet due to reasons mentioned abive.
